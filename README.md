# odin-recipes

This webpage was created to display a couple of recipes. I have not used these recipes before, but the ingredients and steps were obtained from allrecipes.com. Images were obtained from allrecipes.com and google images search.

The purpose of making this webpage was to begin exploring the basics of HTML and git, as well as fulfill the requirements for the recipes project which is apart of the HTML Foundations section of The Odin Project: Foundations course. The project required use of HTML tags like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ol>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` to get students comfortable displaying content such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. Tags such as `<img>` and `<a>` were used to practice linking to images and other pages.

While the website is visually plain, this was the scope of the project. It was intended it to allow students to focus only on things learned so far without getting tripped up on anything new.
